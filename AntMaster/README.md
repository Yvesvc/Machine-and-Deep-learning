AntMaster is a multi-player strategy game in which you control an army of ants that aim to to seek and destroy the most enemy ant hills, while defending their own hills. 
Players must also gather food to spawn more ants.

The objective was to create an AI bot that plays the game as intelligently as possible.
The AI bot achieved a moderate level of game intelligence.
Better results can be achieved through more training, adapting the model's hyperparameters and tweaking the observation and reward space.

Stack/techniques used: Python, Gymnasium, StableBaselines3, Pygame.
